# PokemonTeamPlanner
A site that allows you to view stats of Pokemon and the types they resist or are weak to. I choose Pokemon as I grew up playing the games and I realized there is a lot of numbers and math associated with it, which would translate well into building a site. 

I plan to work on this more as time goes on. Adding the functionality for the team builder, adding Pokemon from the other generations and a recommendation system for your team. I would also like to enhance the design a bit, I'm not too good with design, but I hope to become better.

All rights for Pokemon and related properties belong to Nintendo, Game Freak and Creatures Inc. This is simply a project to apply my learning of PHP and Web Development.
