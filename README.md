# CSC 301 Final Project
This is code for a site allowing you to view stats of Generation I Pokemon and the types they resist or are weak to. I chose Pokemon as I grew up playing the games and I realized there are many numerical aspects such as stats and catch rates.

Initially, I had plans to create user login functionality to save team compositions. However, due to the time constraints present when I was initally assigned this project, I had to scrap the idea. 

I plan to revisit this project one day as my knowledge and experience grows. There are many aspects of the game I have left untouched that I believe can be incorporated. I also want to enhance the design of the site as I placed more emphasis on the backend.

**All rights for Pokemon and related properties belong to Nintendo, Game Freak and Creatures Inc. This is simply a project to apply my learning of PHP and Web Development.**
